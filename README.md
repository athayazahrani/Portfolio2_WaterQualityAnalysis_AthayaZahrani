**Analysis of Water, Sediment, and F1 Fraction Quality in Saguling Reservoir based on Heavy Metal Content (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb) for Water Pollution Control Purposes (in Bahasa)**

In Indonesia, pollution both on land and in water bodies frequently occurs, one of which is heavy metal pollution, which is crucial to consider due to its non-degradable and persistent nature, as well as its ability to accumulate in living organisms. Heavy metals in water are typically found in low concentrations, but human activities can increase their levels, causing environmental problems and impacting ecosystems. Once heavy metals enter water bodies, they accumulate and settle in the sediment, which can eventually be re-released into the water column, becoming secondary pollutants. Sediment plays a critical role in the trace and accumulation of heavy metals, which have the potential to cause toxicity to aquatic organisms.

Saguling Reservoir is the first of three reservoirs that dam the Citarum River in West Java Province. It serves as a Hydroelectric Power Plant (PLTA), a water source for irrigation, floating net cage aquaculture, and raw water for domestic and industrial use. Due to these functions, understanding factors related to water quality, such as heavy metal content in sediment, becomes very important. The water quality of the Upper Citarum River is heavily polluted, and some heavy metals have been recorded as exceeding the acceptable standards. Currently, heavy metal monitoring is only conducted in water, whereas heavy metals have low solubility in water and primarily accumulate in sediments. Therefore, monitoring heavy metal concentrations in water alone is insufficient; further monitoring of heavy metals deposited in the sediment is necessary.

This analysis is expected to assist decision-makers in implementing measures to control water pollution in the Saguling Reservoir. `Water and sediment samples were collected from three locations: Point 4 (Muara Cihaur Kampung Maroko) at coordinates 06º53'13.0" N and 107º25'54.4" E, Point 6 (Muara Ciminyak - floating net cage aquaculture location) at coordinates 06º57'14.6" N and 107º26'03.8" E, and Point 9 (near the Intake structure) at coordinates 06º54'54.4" N and 107º22'26.3" E. Sampling was conducted in January 2018, representing the rainy season.`

`Laboratory analysis was performed on the collected samples to examine the heavy metal content of Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), and Lead (Pb) in water (mg/L), sediment (mg/kg), and F1 Fraction (the portion of heavy metals that is more easily dissolved or released). The samples were placed in a reactor and rotated for 10 minutes at two different speeds, 50 and 100 Rotations per Minute (RPM). After rotation, samples were taken at intervals of 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 minutes to observe when heavy metals might reattach to the sediment (referring to the property of deposition: the re-settling of particles from the medium to the surface or bottom). Each sample was analyzed with the expectation that the longer the sample was left undisturbed, the lower the heavy metal concentration in the water, while it increased in the sediment.`

_The issue of heavy metal pollution in Indonesian waters, including Saguling Reservoir, poses a serious threat to both ecosystems and human health. Heavy metals that accumulate in sediments can become dangerous secondary pollutants, ready to be released back into the water at any time. How does this dynamic unfold, and why is monitoring water alone not enough? Discover essential answers and in-depth analysis that can assist decision-makers, and learn how we can take further steps to protect our waters in this article!_
